# Uncertainty Aware Conformalized Quantile Regression (UACQR)
Here we provide an implementation of UACQR and notebooks to reproduce the figures and tables from "Integrating Uncertainty Awareness into Conformalized Quantile Regression."

We demonstrate how to use our method for neural networks and Quantile Regression Forests in the two demo notebooks.  

For real data experiments, the GetDatasets function and associated assets are a fork from https://github.com/msesia/cqr-comparison
